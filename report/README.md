# Report Template

A simple report template for quick turnaround:
- single paged (in contrast to two paged book layout)
- target at most 2 levels of structures, chapters and sections, to keep it simple.
  The chapter and section names appear on headers. Page numbers are at the bottom.

User actions:
front page:
- bar text and color
- optional top image
- report name and/or a short description
- optional text blocks for authors

Table of contents should be automatically generated afterward.

Then users can do:
```
\chapter{CH 1}
some test
\section{SE 1}
some test 2.

```
