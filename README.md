# Latex Templates

Most publishers, journals, and academies have their own templates. The 
templates here are mainly for casual usages outside of those scopes.
- a problem solving template. Given a problem, spill out the solution.
- a report template. This is a little lengthy article/report for school 
  projects, and others. Usually, it spills over several sections. I think more
  than 5 sections is too much. Break it up if it's the case. 20 pages or less
  is good.
- a booklet template. It has chapters and sections. 60 pages or less are good.

Other options are Markdown, MS Word. But TeX is the king.

## Styles

Here are the styles we care:
- fonts, including font size, style, foreground/background colors
- structure, such as chapters, sections, etc
- math formulae, graphs, etc

## Common Packages

Here are commonly used packages. Like in Python or R, it requires > 100 libs
to get to the fluent level for practical purpose.
- amsmath, amsfonts, amssymb, mathtools
- pgf/tikz/tkz-euclide, pgfplots
- geometry
- xcolor
- booktabs
- fancyhdr
- quotchap, for chapter headers
- hyperref
- kbordermatrix
- subfigure
- graphicx
- enumitem
- subfiles
- microtype
- listings, source code format
- beamer
- minted, algorithms, algorithmicx
- pstricks


When writing or almost doing anything, we need to think about:
- Are we doing it in the right way?
- Are we doing it in the right place?
- Are we doing it in the most efficient way?


## IDEs

Which IDE is the best:
- create projects to group relevant files
- knows the main entry
- auto-complete
- syntax highlight
