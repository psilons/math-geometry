# Latex Templates

Most publishers, journals, and academies have their own templates. The 
templates here are mainly for casual usages outside those scopes.
- a problem-solving template. Given a problem, spill out the solution.
- a report template. This is a little lengthy article/report for school 
  projects, and others. Usually, it spills over several sections. I think more
  than 5 sections is too much. Break it up if it's the case. 20 pages or less
  is good.
- a booklet template. It has chapters and sections. 60 pages or fewer are good.

Other options are Markdown, MS Word. But TeX is the king.

Concentrate on content with minimal formatting.

Suitable for nonstandard cases, such as:
- ad hoc questions
- very specific tasks, such as a particular algorithm, e.g., KMP
- homework
- term project paper
- resume
- ref cards
- technical notes

When writing or almost doing anything, we need to think about:
- Are we doing it in the right way?
- Are we doing it in the right place?
- Are we doing it in the most efficient way?
